#### Ruby things:

##### times method
    10.times { puts "This will be printed 10 times" }

##### !
! at the end of a method usually means modify the original instead of returning a copy

##### blocks
- basically sad lambda expressions..?

      do
      end
      {}
      def double(n)
        yield n
      end 

      puts double(10) { |x| x * 2 }
- you can have a double function that yields to (essentially) a lambda that does the actual doubling for you??
- what the fuck

##### proc 
- a proc is a "saved block"

      cube = Proc.new { |x| x**3 }
      [1, 2, 3].each.map(&cube)

##### Ternary expressions
  puts x < y ? "#{x} is less than #{y}" : "#{x} is not less than #{y}"

##### case statements
    puts "Input command:"
    command = gets.chomp.downcase
  
    case command
      when "add"
        #add something to data structure
      when "remove"
        #remove something from data structure
      else
        puts "command not recognised"

##### conditional assignment
##### implicit return
##### respond_to? method
##### << push/concatenate
##### .collect
  essentially python map (but returns copy) or list comp
  equivalent to ruby .map
